I will use Transfer learning for this image classification

Transfer Learning is a Deep Learning technique where we use a pre-trained model. This pre-trained model is trained for one task and can be re-trained for a similar task with a smaller dataset.

Transfer Learning gives higher accuracy compared to training models from scratch.

Examples of some famous Pre-Trained Models are:

o VGG-16

o ResNet50

o Inceptionv3

o MobileNet V2

here i willuse MobileNet V2


*WORK FLOW*


Data(Image) collection -> Image processing -> train-test split -> use Pretrained MobileNet Model
